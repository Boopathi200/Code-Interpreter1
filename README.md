## Project Overview

The Web Code Interpreter is a client-side application that enables users to write and run code snippets in a browser environment. It supports basic execution for JavaScript code and provides a simple, user-friendly interface.

## Features

- Run JavaScript code directly in the browser
- Real-time output display
- Simple and intuitive user interface
- No server-side code execution required

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get started with the Web Code Interpreter.

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/web-code-interpreter.git
   cd web-code-interpreter
   ```

2. **Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser:**

   You can simply double-click the `index.html` file or drag and drop it into your browser.

## Usage

1. **Open the application:** Launch `index.html` in your browser.

2. **Write your code:** Enter JavaScript code in the code editor area.

3. **Run the code:** Click the "Run" button to execute the code.

4. **View results:** The output will be displayed in the output area below the editor.

## Configuration

This project does not require server-side configuration. All configurations are handled client-side via JavaScript. To customize the user interface or add new features, you can modify the following files:

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that sets up the structure of the web page.
- `styles.css`: The CSS file for styling the user interface.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file responsible for handling code execution and interacting with the DOM.
